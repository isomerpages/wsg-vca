<p>Jane’s passion for both beauty and people led her to a human resources
role in the retail industry, where she has spent almost 20 years honing
her skills in different retail formats.</p>
<p>Her keen sense of people management, planning and recruitment has helped
global organisations build their talent pools, grow their businesses and

Resources at Shilla Travel Retail where she works closely with international
beauty brands.</p>
<p>Jane enjoys journaling her insights when reflecting on her career journey.
Through regular sharing and her volunteer work as a career counsellor,
she hopes to help others discover their passions and find fulfilment in
their careers. As she aptly puts it: “The best reward is to see growth
in the people you coach and mentor.”</p>
