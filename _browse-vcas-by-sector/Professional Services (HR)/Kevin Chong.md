<p><strong>Kevin Chong</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning and Organisational Development Manager, Changi Airport Group</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With nearly a decade of experience in workforce planning and training,
Kevin is on a mission to help others discover their strengths and align
themselves with their vocations.</p>
<p>Kevin describes finding his calling as something that came by accident:
he was working in the creative industries and mentoring a candidate, guiding
her through the development of her portfolio and advising her on her transition
to a new role, when he realised how much he enjoyed helping others realise
their potential. From there, he pivoted into workforce development and
made his mark in public and private sector companies.</p>
<p>Having been at a career crossroads himself and benefited from career coaching,
Kevin is a firm believer that the right mentoring and advice can make a
difference. Through his volunteer work as a career advisor, Kevin hopes
to help others discover their strengths and find both purpose and satisfaction
in their professional lives.</p>
