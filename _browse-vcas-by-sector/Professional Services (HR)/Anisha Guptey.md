<p></p>
<p>Anisha has over a decade of experience in the talent acquisition field.
She is passionate about scaling and building large teams, and finds immense
satisfaction when individuals are inspired to navigate ambiguities, find
purpose, and have fun while hitting their goals.</p>
<p>Over the years, she has interviewed, hired and coached hundreds of candidates
at global organisations.</p>
<p>Rather than prescribe solutions, Anisha prefers to create an environment
where others are able to think critically and draw on their inner strength
to resolve challenges. This coaching-styled management approach paved the
way for her to begin her journey as a career coach, and has become her
“north star” guiding each interaction.</p>
<p>With a healthy mix of both empathy and pragmatism, Anisha hopes to continue
her journey as a coach and strives to continuously improve herself in the
service of others.</p>
