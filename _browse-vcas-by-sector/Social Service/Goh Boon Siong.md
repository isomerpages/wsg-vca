<p>“If we don’t win their hearts today, they will break our hearts tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I was once a troubled youth growing up from difficult, not so well to
do family. My dad is mentally challenged, my mum worked as a factory operator.
I grew up under the care of my grandfather who is a director of the temple.</p>
<p>I remember my primary school motto, “do the best we can” it is simple
yet left a deep impact in me growing up pursuing excellence. My mum love
for me to buy $96 custom-made table tennis bat for me after knowing that
I made it to the school team at primary 3 had made a positive difference.</p>
<p>I got a DSA offer to a SAP school where a kind teacher showed care to
help me in my studies and by God’s grace my life was turnaround. I wanted
to share snippet of my personal story with you to encourage you on in your
search for purpose and meaning in life and work where I am looking forward
to have the privilege to journey further with you :)</p>
<p>My reason for taking up the role of a volunteer Career Advisor is I believed
that we should leave no man behind as our society prosper and progress.
I come on board to serve and be useful to provide sector specific knowledge
which seek to provide greater clarity and exploring with you if there be
a potential job fitting where you can thrive playing to your strengths
to better help others in the social service sector alongside me!</p>
<p>Thank you and I invite you to connect with me!</p>
