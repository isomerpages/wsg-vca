<p><strong>Goh Boon Siong</strong>
</p>
<p>Lead Social Worker, Senior Manager, Youth Guidance Outreach Services</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Boon Siong has over two decades of experience in social work and sees
it as his calling to support children, young people, couples and families
in difficulty—so that no one is left behind.</p>
<p>His passion was sparked from childhood experiences. Having grown up in
an underprivileged home, Boon Siong is no stranger to the challenges that
families can face in navigating finances and relationships. The turning
point in his life came in his teenage years when the combination of his
faith and the compassion of a teacher he met helped him find his direction.
He is now determined to pay it forward.</p>
<p>Boon Siong’s coaching style is characterised by empathy. No matter the
client, he hopes that his compassion speaks volumes and that he is able
to create a safe space where people can find ways to heal and fulfil their
potential</p>
