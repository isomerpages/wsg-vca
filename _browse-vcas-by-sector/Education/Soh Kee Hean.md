<p></p>
<p>Kee Hean is currently an academic with three decades of experience in
the public service, during which time he built his expertise in topics
such as governance, corruption and crime.</p>
<p>His time in the public service saw him move between organisations such
as the Singapore Police Force, Practices Investigation Bureau, Ministry
of Home Affairs, Prisons Service and Council for Estate Agencies. These
experiences honed his skills across a wide range of areas, including leadership,
policy, corporate planning, training and project management. They also
opened his eyes to operations in the ICT, security and real estate sectors.</p>
<p>In 2020, Kee Kean pivoted his career to academia. He joined Singapore
University of Social Sciences, where he now teaches subjects to do with
governance, corruption, policing, crime, public safety and security.</p>
<p>Kee Hean acknowledges that his career journey was only made possible because
of the guidance and support he received along the way. As a Volunteer Career
Advisor, he hopes to pay it forward and do the same for others.</p>
