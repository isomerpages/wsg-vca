<p>I am currently an academic in the Singapore University of Social Sciences,
teaching subjects such as governance and corruption, policing and crime.
Prior to that, I spent three decades in the public service, working in
different environments in the Police Force, CPIB, Home Team Academy, Ministry
of Home Affairs and the Council for Estate Agencies.</p>
<p>I have experience in many areas, including leadership, policy, planning,
operations, procurement, project management, technology and training. I
have worked with industry partners and with the private sector, for eg
those in the ICT industry, security industry and real estate sector. I
continue to keep in touch with a network in the public and the private
sectors. I have received help and learnt much throughout my career.</p>
<p>With what I have gathered, I hope to value add and help others who are
looking for direction and a way forward.</p>
