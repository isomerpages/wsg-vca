<blockquote>
<p><strong>Benjamin Cassim</strong>
</p>
<p>Senior Lecturer, Temasek Polytechnic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benjamin began his career managing business events and destination marketing
initiatives. This sparked his interest in tourism and in 2007 he pivoted
his career to teaching and developing the hospitality and tourism curriculum
at Temasek Polytechnic.</p>
<p>Today, drawing on the years of industry experience under his belt, Benjamin
teaches a broad range of subjects, including but not limited to digital
marketing, business events management, innovation and entrepreneurship,
and revenue management.</p>
<p>Outside of his academic work, Benjamin collaborates with regional and
provincial governments in countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia,
and the Philippines on tourism initiatives. This involvement allows him
to share his knowledge and help create effective technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) frameworks that support the growth of the
tourism industry.</p>
<p>With his diverse experience accumulated over three decades, Benjamin hopes
to inspire and encourage others interested in business or tourism and looks
forward to helping them reach their career goals.</p>
