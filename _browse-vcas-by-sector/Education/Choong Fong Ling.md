executive communications to employer branding, government relations and
digital marketing.</p>
<p>Her latest career move was in 2017, when she ventured into the education
sector and joined the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). Testament

just four years of her taking the reins as Head of Brand, Communication
