<p></p>
<p>Lilian has accumulated over 15 years of experience in the talent space,
with a portfolio spanning industries such as ICT, consumer products and
banking.</p>
<p>Having pivoted her career a few times before finally finding her calling
in human capital, she is no stranger to the changes driven by the constantly
evolving future of work. Her last role before taking a career break was
Head of Early Careers at Visa where she oversaw the attraction, recruitment
and development of young talents.</p>
<p>Lilian has always been grateful to the support, mentoring and coaching
she received throughout her career journey and is now inspired to give
back what she has gained through, her experiences and knowledge with others.</p>
