<p>Operations Manager, Talent Acquisition, Amazon Web Services</p>

<p></p>
<p>I am a Talent Acquisition and Operations Leader with a passion for building
and scaling large teams. In my career so far, I’ve been privileged to interview
and hire over 250 individuals and coach and mentor many. As an empathetic
yet pragmatic people leader, I thrive when I can inspire each individual
on my team to navigate ambiguity, do purposeful work, hit their desired
outcomes and have fun while doing it! Early in my career as a manager,
I found that coaching is a natural fit for my management style. I enjoy
creating an environment where my team can take the time to think critically,
find resolve amidst their challenges and tap into their inner strengths
for empowerment. Over time, this approach became my north star – generating
a hunger to become a better coach in the service of others.</p>
