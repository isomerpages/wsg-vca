</p>
<p>Director, Gemen Pte Ltd</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Keng Wei hails from a humble background. In his secondary years, he took
6 years to complete his O levels and was unable to get into a local polytechnic.
Later on in life, he would go on to attend a private institute and attain
tertiary education certification.</p>
<p>He started his career as a sales executive in education, and eventually
became an account manager in a telecommunication compan. From there, he
was promoted to being Sales Manager and eventually Managing Director of
the APAC region for a German software company in Singapore. This experience
gave him the wide range of exposure to set up his 2 businesses, which are
targeted at catering for the ever-challenging demands of the Financial
Technology (fintech) world.</p>
<p>His objective in being a volunteer career advisor is to encourage fellow
Singaporeans not to give up in finding the right career path for themselves
â€“ it is never too late to change.</p>
