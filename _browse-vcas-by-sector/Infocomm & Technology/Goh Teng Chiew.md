</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Teng Chiew is an IT industry veteran with over 30 years of experience
and who specialises in infrastructure management, virtualisation, cybersecurity
and AI Ethics &amp; Governance.</p>
<p>He has personally experienced the rise of the digital wave, the resulting
transformation of the business landscape and the boons and banes that come
with it. This gave him the chance to cut his teeth in a diverse range areas
such as code development, system administration, end-user support, cybersecurity,
and infrastructure management and more.</p>
<p>In 2019, Teng Chiew started to give back to the sector through career
mentoring. He hopes that he can use his wealth of experience to help others
find meaningful and fulfilling work in the IT industry.</p>
