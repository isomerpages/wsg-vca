<p>I have several decades of IT experiences range from code development,
application development, application team management, system administration,
IT operations and end-user support management, cyber security management
to infrastructure management. Notably projects completed include implementation
of certified IT service processes, cyber security functional capability,
service continuity management and infrastructure virtualisation.</p>
<p>I am open for IT career planning discussion especially on issues pertaining
to infrastructure changes, impact of virtualisation and cloud and cybersecurity
issues.</p>
<p>I am a SCS career mentoring volunteer since 2019. Such mentoring activities
keep me updated on career issues faced by existing IT workers and those
considering switching to IT industry. By sharing my knowledge and experiences,
I hope to assist IT career seekers in better career preparation.</p>
