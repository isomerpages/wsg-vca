<p>Tan Kok Hoe</p>
<p>Director (Corporate Management), Ministry of Manpower</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have worked in the public sector for over 20 years, having been through
a few transformation and change management exercises. I am familiar with
public sector finance, procurement and HR areas of work. As a lifelong
learner in finance and accountancy, I am happy to share with anyone my
experience working in different ministries and statutory boards. I am currently
a public sector coach and also working towards my ACC coaching credential.</p>
