<p>Before you begin your journey with Polaris by VCA, please take a moment
to understand the commitment required and the application process.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note: Please connect with only one Volunteer Career Advisor (VCA). This ensures that each student receives dedicated attention and allows more students to benefit from the programme.</strong>
</p>
<p>Commitment Required:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be proactive in following up with your VCA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the Career Development Plan and share it with your VCA by the
end of the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend meetings mutually agreed and arranged with your VCA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Application Process:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Browse the list of VCAs on our microsite. Read each VCAs' profile to understand
their background and expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have identified a suitable VCA, click the "Connect with Me" button
on their profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill in and submit the connection request form. The VCA will contact you
within a week of your submission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While waiting for a response, download the programme kit and start reflecting
on the career planning questions provided before meeting the VCA.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please Note:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The sessions with the VCA will be focused on providing industry-guided
career planning advice, not job opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a VCA is unable to accept your connection request, the Workforce Singapore
(WSG) team will contact you with alternative options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We recommend for physical meet-ups to be conducted at public venues such
as Careers Connect @ Lifelong Learning Institute (Mon – Fri 9am - 5pm,
Sat 9am – 1pm) or campus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that you will make the most of your Polaris by VCA experience.
We wish you success in your career planning journey!</p>
