<br><strong>4. Sharing of Collected Data<br></strong>
<br>We may share the Collected Data from you with other Government agencies

<br>We will not share your Personal Data and/or Additional Personal Data with
any non-Government entities other than in limited circumstances including
the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>where third party companies perform services for us, including but not
limited to email delivery, hosting and payment processing, or for the purpose
of providing you with the Services that you request from us. However, these
companies will only be entitled to use your personal information in order
to provide the services requested by us or as may be required by law; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where third parties (including other job portals) are engaged by us specifically
for purposes related to employment facilitation, which require your Personal

when using the Website. This may include displaying to you programmes by
WSG or its third-party providers in the form of pop-up advertisements which
may be relevant to your needs.
<br>
<br>For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously
supplied us or other Government agencies or statutory boards. This may
include, where relevant, pre-populating your data with your pre-existing
data from MyInfo when you access the Website as an Individual. This will
speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous
submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest
data.
<br>
<br>Where your use of the Website is concerned, you acknowledge and accept
that certain functions, when activated or used by you, will operate to
send or display information about yourself, including but not limited to,
your Personal Data and/or Additional Personal Data to certain third parties,
and you agree to the sharing of such information with these third parties.
You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be held responsible or accountable
for any loss, injury or damage sustained by you for sharing the aforesaid
information arising out of your activation or use of such features on the
Website.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Anonymous Statistics<br></strong>

<br>
<br><strong>6. Marketing Communications<br></strong>
<br>If you should consent, from time to time you may receive from us a variety
of communications, including but not limited to newsletters, emails and

<br>
<br>At any time, you may change your Marketing Communications preferences,
either by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>electing to opt out from the Marketing Communications sent to you by following
the ‘unsubscribe’ link which can be found at the bottom of the emails;
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contacting our team directly using the ‘Contact Us’ option, found either
in the email we sent or on the Website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

you may receive some important service information that we believe is critical
to the use of our Services. In these exceptional circumstances, such information
will be sent to you regardless of your Marketing Communications preferences.
